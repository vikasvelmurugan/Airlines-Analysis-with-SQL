# Airlines-Analysis-with-SQL

### Business Problem

Our company operates a diverse fleet of aircraft ranging from small
business jets to medium-sized machines. We have been providing
high-quality air transportation services to our clients for several years, and our primary focus is to ensure a safe, comfortable, and convenient journey for our passengers.However, we are currently facing challenges due to several factors such as stricter environmental regulations, higher flight taxes, increased interest rates, rising fuel prices, and a tight labor market resulting in increased labor costs. As a result, the company's profitability is under pressure, and they are seeking ways to address this issue. To tackle this challenge, they are looking to conduct an analysis of their database to find ways to increase their occupancy rate, which can help boost the average profit earned per seat.


### Main challenges

1. Stricter environmental regulations:
The demand on the airlines industry to decrease its carbon footprint is growing, which has resulted in more
stringent environmental laws that raise operating costs and restrict expansion potential.
2. Higher flight taxes:
To solve environmental issues and increase money, governments all around the world are taxiing aircraft more heavily, which
raises the cost of flying and decreases demand.
3. Tight labor market resulting in increased labor costs: 
The lack of trained people in the aviation sector has increased labor costs and increased turnover rates.

### Summary of Basic Analysis 
* Basic Analysis 1,2 and 3 done above will be useful in developing strategies to increase occupancy rates and optimize pricing for each aircraft .
* In order to gain a deeper understanding of the trend of ticket bookings and revenue earned through these bookings, we have utilised a line chart visualisation. Upon analysis of the chart, we observe that <b> the number of tickets booked exhibits a gradual increase from June 22nd to July 7th, followed by a relatively stable pattern from July 8th until August.</b>
*  Flight 319 seems to be expensive in both business and economy class as compared to the other flights. 
* Aircraft 773 provides a comfort variant and CN1 and CR2 provide only economy class.

### CONCLUSION
* SU9 aircraft has the highest total revenue and it can also be seen that the price of business class and economy class is the lowest in this aircraft.
* CN1 aircraft has the least revenue and possible reasons could be that it provides only economy class with very less price and it might be because of the poor conditions or less facilities. 
* As we saw that when we increased occupancy rate by 10%, the annual turnover also increased. Occupancy rates can be increased by implementing better adveritsing and marketing strategies.
